# HW5
my hourly scheduler gives you the option to schedule your day from 8 to 5, 
the text field allows you to input what you need to do for that time.
then click the save button to save it to the local storage.
the different hours will change colors due to the actual time.
the past, present and future hours will all be different colors.
